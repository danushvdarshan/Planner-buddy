# Planner Buddy — Product Vision

Planner Buddy is a weekly planning assistant designed to help users
allocate their tasks into available time slots based on priority.

The system divides a week into discrete time slots and first accounts
for fixed, non-negotiable commitments. Remaining free slots are then
filled with user-defined tasks using priority-based rules.

The goal is to produce an explainable, deterministic weekly plan
that helps users improve consistency and time utilization.
