# Scheduling Rules

1. A week consists of 7 days with 24 one-hour slots per day.
2. Fixed commitments cannot be moved or overwritten.
3. Tasks have a priority: High, Medium, or Low.
4. Higher-priority tasks are scheduled before lower-priority tasks.
5. Tasks require contiguous time slots equal to their duration.
6. If no suitable slots are available, the task remains unassigned.
7. The scheduling process is deterministic and explainable.
